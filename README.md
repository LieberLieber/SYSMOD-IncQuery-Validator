> The real strength of MBSE is not the diagrams, but that tools can read the data and support the engineers in their work. A validator is a nice application of this. Modeling SysML without validation is like programming without running the compiler. The SYSMOD validator shows where the model does not follow the SYSMOD procedure. (Tim Weilkiens)
